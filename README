GraGL!
------

GraGL is a framework for prototyping 2D interactions and interfaces using Python.
It takes care of the confusing part- setting up a pixel-perfect 2D OpenGL context- and provides some handy functions for developing 2D applications quickly.
It's built in the style of Processing and OpenFrameworks, so if you're familiar with those you will pick this up quickly.

Some algorithms are borrowed; credit is given where that happens.

DEPENDENCIES.
-------------

Of course there's a catch- here are some dependencies.

the only truly necessary piece:
    ~PyOpenGL 3         http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOpenGL

for images (GraGL_image.py):
    ~PIL                http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
    ~numpy              http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/

for fonts (GraGL_typeface.py):
    ~PIL                http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
    ~FreeType           (a C library)
                        > http://freetype.sourceforge.net/download.html#stable
                        > or in macports: "sudo port install freetype"
    ~freetype-py        http://code.google.com/p/freetype-py/downloads/list

AS FAR AS I KNOW

this should work on multiple platforms, though I've only tested it on OS X 10.4 and 10.7.
